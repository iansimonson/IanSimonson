#Tl;Dr

This is the source code for my personal website written in NodeJS. Feel free to copy, use, read, whatever you'd like.

#Use

You probably don't have much use for just copying and pasting the source code directly (unless you are also named Ian Simonson in which case, go for it) but hopefully this project can help those also looking to learn NodeJS. At the very least it will show you what not to do (and over time maybe the code will be refactored and you'll get to see what to do also).

#Why

I needed a personal site/blog to do what bloggers do, talk about things (softare related) they find cool, or some project they're working on. So I've built my own in NodeJS to learn more about NodeJS (two birds, one stone).

#License

This source is released under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/) because I've learned by reading, copying, and altering other's code to my needs, and I believe others should do the same.
