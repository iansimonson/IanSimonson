      Welcome. This is my personal site for hosting contact information
      as well as a blog. As time goes on I plan to add more modules
      on the site navigation as I learn more about web technologies. All
      source files for this site are available on #[a(href= githubLink) GitHub].

    p.
      Take a look around. The design is a continuous work in progress, and I
      am trying to use the #[a(href= "http://www.csszengarden.com/") CSS Zen Garden]
      approach. If you have any CSS tips/layout suggestions feel free
      to send me an email.
